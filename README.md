Just a fun side project for visualizing the Mondos in your wallet. I hope everyone enjoys the outputs as much as I enjoyed the process of making it.

Although it's really impressive that this thing currently runs clientside in the browser, that unfortunately means that its performance depends heavily on the power of your own hardware.  So just don't be poor I guess.  Optimization passes, GPU support, and multithreading are all hopefully coming at some point down the line if I get bored enough / have spare time.
